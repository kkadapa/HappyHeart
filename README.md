# HappyHeart

Happy Heart is an Apple Watch App in which we use Sequencing.com's Real-Time Personalization (RTP) technology (genetically tailored) and Apple Watch Heart rate data to calculate cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular diseases. We also generate recommended customized grocery list and nutritional summary based on genetic data. We presented this idea in one of our hackathons hosted by Microsoft sponsored by Lifenome, Sequencing.com https://sequencing.com/hackathons/hack-the-genome-times-square-nyc-2018
